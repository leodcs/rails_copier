  <p>A simple gem that allows you to copy a rails project, including all it's folders, configurations.</p>

  <p>The main gole here is to provide a way of quickly starting a 'new' rails project without having to deal with all that heavy starting configuration (mostly on frontend) we often come across</p> 

</div>

## Installation

Having Ruby working environment properly set up, install <b>rails_coppier</b> as:

    $ gem install rails_coppier

## Usage

We have 3 required flags to be passed:
  <ul>
    <li> --from
    <li> --to
    <li> --name
  </ul>

Let's say we want to copy a project from the current folder to the parent folder, giving to it a new name of <b>NewProject</b>:
 
```ruby 
  rails_coppier --from . --to .. --name NewProject
```

or even the short version

```ruby 
  rails_coppier -f ./placecar --to . --name NewProject
```
